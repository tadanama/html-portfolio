<h1>Syakir's Movie Recommendation</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies or anime shows</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Hitman's Bodyguard</h3>
<p>Good action comedy movie. Very entertaining.</p>

<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>A show about sorcerers. Cool animations. Season 2 is a quite depressing tho.</p>

<h3>Kimetsu no Yaiba </h3>
<p>Love all the characters. All of them has a sad story but at least the main character is a positive guy.</p>
